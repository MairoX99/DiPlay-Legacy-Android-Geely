/**
 * Picks the port the AirPlay listener binds.
 *
 * 7000 is the port AirPlay conventionally uses, and on a head unit it is also a port something else can be
 * holding — a DiPlay process that did not exit, or another app. Failing to bind it used to end the whole wireless
 * attempt. The iPhone is told the port in the Bonjour record and in the iAP2 Wi-Fi configuration, so any free
 * port reaches us just as well; only the port number changes.

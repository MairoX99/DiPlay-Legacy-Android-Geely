/**
 * Fits a report into a byte budget without spending it on repetition.
 *
 * The field reports were four near-identical runs of "started, looked for a USB device, found none":
 * the budget went on saying the same thing four times, and the line that explained the failure was
 * never in the file. So the budget is spent in a fixed order — signal lines from every run first, then
 * the newest run in full, then older runs — and every run's consecutive repeats cost one line and a
 * count instead of one line each. Whatever does not fit is stated, because a report that quietly loses
 * a line reads exactly like a run where the line never happened.
 *
 * The kept lines are then put back in the order they happened, run by run, because a reader has to be
 * able to read the report top to bottom.

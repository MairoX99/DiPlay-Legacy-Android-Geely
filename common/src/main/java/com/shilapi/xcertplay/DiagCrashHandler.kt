/**
 * Writes an uncaught exception into the session log before the process dies.
 *
 * Nothing did this. A crash took every line the stack had not yet flushed and left no record of the
 * exception itself, so the report a driver sent described the run up to the crash and never the crash —
 * the one fact that needs no interpreting. This appends synchronously: [SessionLogFile] keys its state
 * by absolute path, so a new instance writes into the same file the page is writing, and a crash must
 * not go through the page's queue, which a dying process never drains.
